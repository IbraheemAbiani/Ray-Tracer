# Ray-Tracer

In this graphics project, ray tracing is used to generate images of 3 dimensional objects in a 3 dimensional environment. It works by projecting a ray from a specified camera position into an environment and outputs the specific pixel color returned by the ray. An image is constructed from the thousands of rays which all return a pixel color that is determined by their path. The rays emulate the behaviour of light rays so details such as shade or transparency on an object can be seen in the output image.
